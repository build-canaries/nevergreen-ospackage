# Nevergreen OS Package

## What is Nevergreen?

Nevergreen is a build monitor with attitude. It is awesome for two reasons:

-	Your builds should always be green. Nevergreen understands this and only shows you jobs that have failed or are building.
-	Nevergreen uses HTML localStorage. So the config is stored in your web browser. You only need to run it once to host hundreds of different build monitors.

## How to use this repo

This repo uses the [Gradle Linux Packaging Plugin](https://github.com/nebula-plugins/gradle-ospackage-plugin) to build a deployable Nevergreen package to make running your own instance easier.

This repo contains some sensible defaults so may be used without changes. Some simple settings can be overridden by creating a gradle.properties file, see the [Gradle docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html) for more details about placing this file in the correct place. 

Alternatively if you need to make more involved changes you can fork this repo and just use it as a base.
